# iCliQ - EDP Project

![iCliQ Logo](/Images/iCliQ_logo.png)

## Introduction 

iCliQ is a wearable that helps public speakers, presenters to manage their time during presentation.

Users can identify the time flags of their speech by vibration patterns and the color of the RGB light.

We (_**Company of Noobs**_) built this product under the _Engineering Design Project_ module during the second semester.

## Libraries Used

1. [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library.git) - a graphics library for Arduino and Arduino-compatible devices

2. [Adafruit SSD1306](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306) - drives OLED displays based on the SSD1306 driver chip

3. [Wire.h](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/Wire/src/Wire.h) - used for I2C communication. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a communication protocol that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other using a two-wire interface, typically labeled as SDA (Serial Data Line) and SCL (Serial Clock Line).

4. [ESP32time](https://github.com/fbiego/ESP32Time) - An Arduino library for setting and retrieving internal RTC time on ESP32 boards

5. [ESP32 BLE Keyboard library](https://github.com/T-vK/ESP32-BLE-Keyboard) - allows you to make the ESP32 act as a Bluetooth Keyboard and control what it does.

6. [BLEDvice.h](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/libraries/BLE/src/BLEDevice.h) - provides an API for working with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals and central devices

7. [ezButton Library for Arduino](https://github.com/ArduinoGetStarted/button) - make it easy to use push button, momentary switches, toggle switch, magnetic contact switch (door sensor)..â€‹.
