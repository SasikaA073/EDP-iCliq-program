# iCliq - EDP Project
ble-mouse has the code to connect to a PC/phone and control using button
button.h header should be in the same folder for code to work. (for button debounce)
vibrator_pwm can be used to up the vibrator

### Functionalities

- set the timer 
- use bluetooth low energy
- timing algorithm
2.1 Screen Menu
Operation view
Configuration view (Time set)
custom time frames
pre defined custom time blocks
Note card view
2.2 Timing algorithm
Predefined blocks 
custom block 
2.3 Vibration pattern algorithm
on/off 
2.4 Mobile App (MIT App Inventor)
2.5 LED bulb
2.6 Laser pointer

Speech Mode 
    - vibrator on 
    - laser Mode
    - slide change

CountUp mode 

[] - count up
[] - change timer to show in 30s
[] - change font
[] - try using both cores of CPU
[] - add animation between speech mode, time change mode
[] - vibrator motor on
[] - laser on 
[] - slide change
